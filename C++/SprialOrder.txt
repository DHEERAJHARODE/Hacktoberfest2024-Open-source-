Algorithm: (We are given 2D matrix of n X m ).
1. We will need 4 variables:
a. row_start - initialized with 0.
b. row_end - initialized with n-1.
c. column_start - initialized with 0.

d. column_end - initialized with m-1.
2. First of all, we will traverse in the row row_start from column_start
to column_end and we will increase the row_start with 1 as we have
traversed the starting row.
3. Then we will traverse in the column column_end from row_start to
row_end and decrease the column_end by 1.
4. Then we will traverse in the row row_end from column_end to
column_start and decrease the row_end by 1.
5. Then we will traverse in the column column_start from row_end to
row_start and increase the column_start by 1.
6. We will do the above steps from 2 to 5 until row_start <= row_end
and column_start <= column_end.
