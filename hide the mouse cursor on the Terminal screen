#Python program to hide the mouse cursor on the Terminal screen


# Python program for the above approach 
import curses 
import time 

# Initializing curses 
stdscr = curses.initscr() 

# Setting the cursor to visible by 
# inserting 1 as argument 
curses.curs_set(1) 

# Delay of 2 seconds 
time.sleep(2) 

# Setting the cursor to invisible by 
# inserting 0 as argument 
curses.curs_set(0) 

# Delay of 2 seconds 
time.sleep(2) 

# Setting the cursor to visible by 
# inserting 1 as argument 
curses.curs_set(1) 

# Delay of 2 seconds 
time.sleep(2) 

# Restoring terminal to it's 
# original state
