Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
  
Solution :

class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0 ;
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        
        return ( n*(n+1)/2 - sum ); 
    }
};

Solution Approach:
First we find sum of elements of the given array.
Then, we can get the missing number by subtracting the sum of first n natural numbers from the calculated sum of the array.

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
